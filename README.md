Unit 1 Project - Making a simple web game

# Scope

Objective is to create a simple web game that will have a character on screen that will evolve into different character levels. Users will be able to press various buttons in order to care for the character. The evolution process will be incremented with time and as long as certain conditions are met, the character will evolve. The game will end either if character dies or the character reaches various parameters.

# User Stories

Player will begin with a prompt on the page where they will be asked to enter their name.

Once the name has been entered, that will be the name of the character, who will become a boot camp student learning how to code. As a student, the parameters that the character will need to maintain are, health, sleep, and study (no personal life for a boot camp student).
